# Weighted values allow you to specify an arbitrary numeric weight to each possible value.  The value will 
# be 'chosen' based on that weight relative to the other weights.  For example, the sum of the total weights
# here is 107, so the 'One Winner!' value will be emitted about 5 times every 107 calls.
