##### Purpose

This is a compilation of my study of Metamarkets' Druid (a real-time analytics data store). My hope is that this repository will allow you to accomplish three main goals: (1) be able to quickly have Druid setup, (2) understand how to run queries on Druid, and (3) understand how Druid indexes and processes realtime data.
